# ðŸ§ª ChemSim AI: Reaction Forecaster

ChemSim AI is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that uses a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast the dynamics of a synthetic chemical reaction. Users can set initial conditions, define a time horizon, and visualize the predicted mass of reactants and products over time. The app also includes an AI chatbot to answer questions about the forecast results.
